             Our algorithms combine mathematical techniques and emerging high-performance computing hardware (e.g., multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and computing clusters) to achieve 
             computational scalability. The goal is to make these developments accessible to academic and industrial users by implementing algorithms on easy-to-use and extensible 
             software libraries.<br><br>
             Furthermore, We have applied the algorithms and tools to help collaborators address engineering and scientific questions that arise in diverse application 
             domainsincluding conflict resolution in energy system design, robust control of crystallization systems, predictive control of wind turbines, power management in 
             large networks, estimation of microbial growth models, and image classification for contaminant detection. <br><br>
